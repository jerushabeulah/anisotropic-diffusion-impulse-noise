Project to remove impulse (salt and pepper) noise using anisotropic diffusion on remote sensing images.



This is my undergraduate project. It takes noisy satellite or remote sensing images and removes salt and pepper noise using anisotropic diffusion. The clean images are saved in the results folder.
